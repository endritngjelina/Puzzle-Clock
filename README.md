# Puzzle-Clock ⏰

Puzzle Clock is a fun and interactive web app that challenges you to **decode the current time** in cryptic formats.  
Instead of showing time in the usual digital or analog way, the clock disguises it using formats like:

- 🔢 Binary  
- 😀 Emoji  
- 🎨 Color  
- •– Morse Code  
- Ⅻ Roman Numerals  

Every day, you can test your skills, build streaks, and track your stats while learning to read different symbolic systems!
